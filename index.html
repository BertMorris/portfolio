            <p>
              I initially embarked on a general Python programming course with
              the aim of learing the techniques for gathering, manipulating, and
              analyzing stock market data. While exploring trading ideas, I
              frequently encountered references to market statistics, prompting
              me to verify and explore these figures myself. Throughout the
              course, I found myself increasingly captivated by the vast
              possibilities afforded by software development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following the Python course, I sought to diversify my skills and
              delve into different programming applications. Continuing along
              the path of data analysis, I pursued the Google Data Analytics
              Certificate. This program equipped me with a solid foundation in
              data analysis techniques and their application across diverse
              contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shortly thereafter, I seized an opportunity to qualify for an IBZ
              Mainframe z/OS Apprenticeship through Franklin Apprenticeships by
              completing a pre-apprenticeship program. This comprehensive
              curriculum covered coursework in general computer science,
              mainframe architecture, system programming, and professional
              skills such as agile development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Subsequently, I plunged into web development headfirst, beginning
              with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After completing several projects
              and feeling confident in my web knowledge foundation, I progressed
              to learning React and later adopted Next.js as my primary
              framework.
